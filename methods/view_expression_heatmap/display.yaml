    View and explore expression data as a sortable heatmap.  Conditions/Samples are displayed on each row
    with some summary statistics averaged across the selected features.  The conditions can be sorted
    by those values.  Each of the selected features is represented in a simple heatmap in the table.
    Mouseover the heatmap to view specific expression values.
