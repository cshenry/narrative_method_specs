description : |
    This method accepts an Expression data matrix and a Genome and attempts to associate
    the rows in the data to features in the Genome.  The matching is performed by simply comparing
    the row IDs to genome feature IDs or aliases.  Methods that operate on expression data
    often rely on this mapping between rows and features to properly function.
